<h1 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-3 mb-8" id="easterEgg2">... And a huge Star Wars Fan!</h1>
<p class="text-xl">The Clone Wars is peak Star Wars 📈. Rebels is pretty good too. 
    Empire Strikes back, Revenge of the Sith and Rogue One are top tier movies 🎬. 
    Don't talk to me about the sequels, they don't exist😤. Also, how good is Lego Star Wars?! 🔥</p>
