<h1 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-3 mb-8" id="easterEgg2">... And a Huge Death Note Fan!</h1>
<p class="text-xl">
Death Note is the pinnacle of psychological thrillers 📖. The battle of wits between Light Yagami and L is unmatched 🧠.  
"Silence" and "L's Theme" are absolute masterpieces in anime soundtracks 🎶.  
The first 25 episodes are legendary 🕊️ (we don't talk about what came after 😅).  
Ryuk's love for apples? Iconic 🍎. Also, how awesome is it to imagine writing names in a Death Note? (For justice, of course!) 🖋️  
All hail Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata for this masterpiece 🙌.
