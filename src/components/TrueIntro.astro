My area of research is focused on Deep Reinforcement Learning, though LLMs are getting pretty interesting too 👀. 
I'm also an electronics enthusiast, who loves tinkering with stuff, and low level programming. 
I love learning new things, and if I find that if I have a specific need, I make a tool for it from scratch, because why not?
But I'm not <em>*totally*</em> a nerd 🤓. I love playing Football ⚽, Rock Climbing 🧗‍♂️, Board Games 🃏 and I also play the Ukulele 🎵.
