Hello! I'm currently working as {vowelStart ? 'an' : 'a'} <b>{data.role}</b> at <b>{data.lab}, {data.university}</b>.  
I'm a penultimate-year B.Tech student at the International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad (IIIT-H), pursuing Computer Science and Engineering.  
My research interests lie at the intersection of Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing, with a particular focus on knowledge-infused learning and model interpretability.  
Currently, I'm exploring innovative approaches to enhance model understanding and reasoning capabilities.  
When not diving into research, I enjoy reading, writing, and finding ways to connect technical concepts with real-world applications.
